The date is positioned too close to the scrollbar but the design document doesn't mention anything about it.

I thought I could easily export "Plus Icon" and "Checkbox" as svg or sth like that from
design resources, but I later realized that I can't properly work with .sketch on my linux OS or do I?

So i spent some time trying to create them with css as close as I could, sorry for that.

Also, the time format mentioned in the design document seems strange to me, as we are deleting tasks after one minute.
I thought it would be better to use a date format like "hh:mm:ss" but it's just a note.

It took about 4.5 hours to complete the task.
The most time consuming part was the design, I had to spend some time to figure out how to work with it (tried to install sketch on PopOS, tried sketch web, tried to find an SVGs for the icons, but after all - just used a provided html file).
I think it took me about 2.5-3 hours to complete the design part. And the rest of the time was spent on the logic.
