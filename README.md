The date is positioned too close to the scrollbar.
The design document doesn't mention anything about it.
I thought I could easily export "Plus Icon" and "Checkbox" as svg or sth like that from
design resources, but I later realized that I can't properly work with .sketch on my linux OS or do I?
So i spent some time trying to create them with css as close as I could, sorry for that.
